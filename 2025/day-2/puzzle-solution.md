# Day 2: Gift Shop

## Part 1

Elves played on the gift shop computer and added invalid product IDs to the gift shop database.

### Invalid IDs

Invlaid IDs are any IDs that have some sequence of digits that are repeated _exactly_ twice.
ie. `1234` is a valid ID, but `12341234` is not since 1234 is repeated twice.
